# BOOK CATALOGUE

A simple full‑stack application that lets you add, view, edit and delete books from a MongoDB collection.  
The front‑end is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS served by Express, while the back‑end uses Mongoose to persist data.

## 🔧 API Endpoints

| Method | Path        | Description                     |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| POST   | `/books`    | Add a new book (JSON body)      |
| GET    | `/books`    | Retrieve all books              |
| PATCH  | `/books/:id`| Update a book by ID             |
| DELETE | `/books/:id`| Delete a book by ID             |

All responses are JSON. The front‑end consumes these endpoints directly.

## 🎨 Front‑End Highlights

- **Dynamic Color Palette** – `getColorForGenre()` assigns a distinct color per genre.
- **Modal Editing** – Replaces prompt dialogs with a polished modal for editing books.
- **Responsive Layout** – Books displayed as card “covers” with hover actions.

## 📚 Data Model (`models/Books.js`)

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const booksSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  author: { type: String, required: true },
  genre: { type: String, required: true },
  year: { type: String, required: true },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("Books", booksSchema);
```
